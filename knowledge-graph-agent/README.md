# Knowledge Graph Agent (Lexi, Phase 0–1)

This agent watches configured article sources, extracts candidate AI terminology, and curates a tiered knowledge structure. It is the working prototype of **Lexi**, the AI lexicographer described in [`lexi-spec.md`](</C:/dev/ai-terminology/lexi-spec.md>).

## The three-tier model

The spec defines three tiers; the agent operates against the first two:

| Tier | What it is | File | Who writes it |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Graph** | Promoted, canonical terms. Visible at the public knowledge graph. | [`graph-data.js`](</C:/dev/ai-terminology/graph-data.js>) (curated base) + [`graph-data-agent.js`](</C:/dev/ai-terminology/graph-data-agent.js>) (overlay) | Nicole curates the base. The overlay is **propose-only** — graph promotions and substantive definition changes go to [`proposals.json`](./proposals.json) for Nicole to approve. |
| **2. Longlist** | Terms under observation, awaiting evidence to support promotion. | [`longlist.json`](./longlist.json) | The agent autonomously adds new terms and merges new sources into existing entries (matrix-configured; see below). |
| **3. Rejected** | Terms the agent considered and rejected, with reasons. | Per-run in [`out/latest-report.json`](./out/latest-report.json) (per-article harvest), and as `action` events with outcome `rejected` in the deterministic log (see below). | The agent records rejections inline. |

## The permissions matrix

Every state-changing action the agent can take is named in [`actions.mjs`](./actions.mjs) — the single source of truth for what Lexi can do. Each action maps, per phase, to one of four gates:

| Gate | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `AUTONOMOUS` | The agent acts directly; the action is logged. |
| `PROPOSE` | The agent writes a proposal to [`proposals.json`](./proposals.json) with `status: "pending"`. Nicole reviews, sets status to `approved` or `rejected`, then the apply step (TBD) commits. |
| `HUMAN_IN_LOOP` | Pre-publication human review required (e.g. Word of the Day). |
| `NEVER` | Not allowed under any circumstances. |

The matrix is derived directly from [`lexi-spec.md` §5](</C:/dev/ai-terminology/lexi-spec.md>). Notable current gates under Phase 1:

- `ADD_TO_LONGLIST` — `AUTONOMOUS` (the spec's strict reading is `PROPOSE` until Phase 2; we're holding that flip until an approval CLI exists).
- `EDIT_GRAPH_DEF_SUBSTANTIVE` — `PROPOSE`. Refresh suggestions from the definition-review pass land in the proposals queue.
- `PROMOTE_TO_GRAPH` — `PROPOSE`. (Not yet emitted by any code path — promotion eligibility logic is downstream work.)
- `REMOVE_GRAPH_NODE` — `NEVER`.

**Default-deny clause** (spec §5): any action not in the matrix, or with no gate at the current phase, is dropped and logged to `report.notes`. The agent never executes an unknown action.

## The proposals queue

[`proposals.json`](./proposals.json) is the receiving end of every `PROPOSE`-gated action. Each entry has:

```json
{
  "id": "<sha-1 of action+target+timestamp>",
  "action": "edit_graph_def_substantive",
  "gate": "propose",
  "proposedAt": "<ISO timestamp>",
  "status": "pending",
  "source": "definition-review",
  "target": { "kind": "graph_node", "id": "ai-accelerator" },
  "payload": { "def": "...", "refs": [...] },
  "reason": "..."
}
```

To approve a proposal: edit its `status` to `"approved"`. To reject: set to `"rejected"`. The apply step that commits approvals is forthcoming (Phase D work).

## The deterministic log

Per spec §11, the orchestration code (`run.mjs`) writes a deterministic event log to [`log/events.ndjson`](./log/) — append-only, one JSON event per line, never rewritten. **This is the system of record**, separate from Lexi's self-reports (`report.json`, `longlist.json`, `proposals.json`). When something goes wrong, debugging from Lexi's self-reports means debugging via the testimony of the thing that broke; the deterministic log is the independent witness.

The log is gitignored (operational forensics data, grows per run, not source). It lives only on the machine where the agent ran.

Every run emits at minimum:

| Event kind | When | Notable fields |
|---|---|---|
| `run_start` | Once at start | `model`, `phase`, `extractPromptVersion`, `reviewPromptVersion`, `sourcesConfigured` |
| `api_call` | Per Claude API call (extract per article + one review) | `call`, `promptVersion`, `inputs` (URL/title), `outputs` (counts/summary), `durationMs`, `errored`, `errorMessage` |
| `action` | Per action routed through the permissions matrix | `action` (from `ACTIONS`), `gate`, `outcome` (`applied` / `proposed` / `dropped` / `errored`), `target`, `payload`, `reason`, `source` |
| `run_end` | Once at end (success path) | `articlesProcessed`, `longlistTotal`, `longlistAddedThisRun`, `proposalsQueuedThisRun`, etc. |
| `run_errored` | Instead of `run_end` if the run throws | `errorMessage`, `errorStack` |

Common fields on every event: `ts` (ISO timestamp UTC), `runId` (UUID grouping all events of one invocation), `phase`, `selfEval` (currently `null`; placeholder for spec §15 self-check output when that lands).

To inspect a recent run:

```bash
# Last 20 events
tail -n 20 knowledge-graph-agent/log/events.ndjson | jq .

# All actions of one run (replace <uuid>)
grep '"runId":"<uuid>"' knowledge-graph-agent/log/events.ndjson | grep '"kind":"action"' | jq .
```

**Prompt version hashes** appear in every relevant event. They roll forward automatically when either system prompt is edited — the historical record stays interpretable when prompts change.

## What it does on each run

1. Fetches recent articles from configured RSS/Atom feeds and HTML index pages.
2. For each article, calls Claude to identify terminology candidates worth tracking. The prompt distinguishes:
   - **New terms** — not in the graph or longlist → added to the longlist with one source.
   - **Re-sightings** — terms already on the longlist that this article materially uses → an additional source is recorded on the existing longlist entry, advancing it toward promotion-eligibility.
   - **Already-canonical** — terms already in the graph → must not be proposed.
3. Reviews a rotating slice of existing graph definitions against the fetched articles. Refresh suggestions are captured as proposals in the report; **nothing is applied to the graph autonomously**.
4. Persists the longlist, run state, and a machine-readable report.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

   ```powershell
   cd "C:\dev\ai-terminology\knowledge-graph-agent"
   npm install
   ```

2. Review [`config.mjs`](./config.mjs). It starts with a small official-source set:
   OpenAI News RSS, Anthropic Newsroom, Google DeepMind News, and the Google AI Blog RSS feed.
3. Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in your shell.
4. Optionally set `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` (default: `claude-sonnet-4-6`).
5. Optionally set `LEXI_PHASE` (default: `1`). Drives the permissions matrix in [`actions.mjs`](./actions.mjs).

## Run

```powershell
$env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
node "C:\dev\ai-terminology\knowledge-graph-agent\run.mjs"
```

## Output files

- **Tier 2 longlist**: [`longlist.json`](./longlist.json) — the watchlist of terms the agent is observing, with sources, source counts, and timestamps.
- **Proposals queue**: [`proposals.json`](./proposals.json) — every `PROPOSE`-gated action lands here for Nicole's review.
- **Tier 1 graph overlay** (currently empty under propose-only discipline): [`agent-patch.json`](./agent-patch.json) and [`graph-data-agent.js`](</C:/dev/ai-terminology/graph-data-agent.js>).
- **Run state** (dedup, review cursor): [`state.json`](./state.json).
- **Latest report** (per-article harvest, rejections, default-deny notes): [`out/latest-report.json`](./out/latest-report.json).
- **Pre-Lexi rollback snapshot** (the prototype's pre-discipline output, preserved as a comparison test case): [`pre-lexi-rollback/`](./pre-lexi-rollback/).

## Promotion (longlist → graph)

Per the spec's credibility bar, a longlist entry is eligible for promotion when:

1. **Source count ≥ 2 independent sources** (different domain, and ideally different author).
2. **Recency** — at least one sighting within the last 90 days.
3. **Time on longlist ≥ 14 days** (anti-haste).
4. **Definition consistency** across sources.
5. **Concept reality check** — names a concept not already covered by an existing graph node.

This eligibility check is not yet implemented in code; promotion is currently a manual review step pending Phase A's downstream phases.

## Notes

- `html_index` sources are useful for official newsroom pages that do not expose a public RSS feed. They work by following article links that match configured URL patterns.
- Each per-article extract call sends an identical Tier-1 + Tier-2 prefix marked with `cache_control: { type: "ephemeral" }`, so Claude can serve it from the prompt cache after the first request in a run.
- Newly created longlist entries within the same run are not visible to *later* extract calls in that run (the cached prefix is a snapshot); cross-article re-sightings still get caught by `classifyCandidate` against the live longlist and are recorded as additional sources on the existing entry.
- The Claude calls use the Messages API with `output_config.format` (json_schema) for structured JSON output:

  - [Structured Outputs](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/structured-outputs)
